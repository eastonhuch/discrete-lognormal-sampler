# Discrete Log-normal Sampler

This repo has the code for Easton's course project in STATS 608: Monte Carlo Methods in Statistics.
It fits a discrete Log-normal normal to count data, estimating the mean and variance as functions of a design matrix, x.
Optionally, it can also estimate an autocorrelation parameter.
Feel free to reuse this code and the ideas contained in it.
If you'd like to write a scientific paper based on this model, I would love to be involved.
